# EpicAnagram
**Mission Statement**<br>
Making an awesome and meanigful user name is hard. An epic anagram like Lord Voldemort would be perfect but, making an anagram can be so hard.
It's so easy to loose lettters, and you need so many tabs to help you make one.
We want to streamline the process to enable everyone to have an awesome username. Now when you join the metaverse, or an rpg, you'll be prepared.

**How to use**
1. Input your full name (or whatever portion you want to work with) into the name input box on the top left
2. In the word console enter a word you would like to have in your name.
    - *If we can't make that word we'll come up with suggestions that can be made with the remaining letters in your word bank*
3. Keep adding words until you're ready to make an epic name.
    - *If you want to remove a word click the 'x' button to add it's letters back to your word bank*
4. Now click the epic name generator to generate a plethora of epic names to chose from. (Names will use all remaing letters and can be one or two names long)
    - *If you want to restart clear all words, but don't worry we'll keep track of this final creation for you to come back to incase you liked part of it*

Ways to improve
Responding with every word possible from a list of letters yields an absurd amount of words
Many words are useless, such as "well", "to", "too", "furthermore".
We should create a smaller dictionary of words that are relavent
The smaller dictionary should not include overly specific scientific words such as "Cerebrum"
We can also seperate all our dictionaries into noun, verb, adjective
Additionally we should memoize searches. ex. if a search for "aabccd" was made than we can use that too simplify the search for "aabccdghi"
Also, only words at a length of 4 or more will be presented because humans can easily find words of length 3 (this also works with a partial trie of length 4)
Remove proper noun, conjunction, preposition, interjection, sounds and effects
