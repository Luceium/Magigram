# EpicAnagram
**Mission Statement**<br>
Making an awesome and meanigful user name is hard. An epic anagram like Lord Voldemort would be perfect but, making an anagram can be so hard.
It's so easy to loose lettters, and you need so many tabs to help you make one.
We want to streamline the process to enable everyone to have an awesome username. Now when you join the metaverse, or an rpg, you'll be prepared.

**How to use**
1. Input your full name (or whatever portion you want to work with) into the name input box on the top left
2. In the word console enter a word you would like to have in your name.
    - *If we can't make that word we'll come up with suggestions that can be made with the remaining letters in your word bank*
3. Keep adding words until you're ready to make an epic name.
    - *If you want to remove a word click the 'x' button to add it's letters back to your word bank*
4. Now click the epic name generator to generate a plethora of epic names to chose from. (Names will use all remaing letters and can be one or two names long)
    - *If you want to restart clear all words, but don't worry we'll keep track of this final creation for you to come back to incase you liked part of it*
