            <ul>
                <li className="ml-7 list-disc">Use the "Starts With" filter to search for a word or variant of a word you have in mind.</li>
                <li className="ml-7 list-disc">Use the "Contains" filter to find words that use difficult characters or abundant characters. You wouldn't want to generate a name with 5 A's in it.</li>
                <li className="ml-7 list-disc">Search for a noun and adjective before generating a name.</li>
                <li className="ml-7 list-disc">A common start is "I am".</li>
            </ul>
